[Summary]

The text consists of a series of quotes from Martin Luther King Jr.'s I
Have a Dream speech. It emphasizes King's vision of racial equality and
his belief in the power of hope and faith to bring about change. However,
as a summary of the speech, it falls short as it does not provide
a comprehensive overview of the speech's main themes, arguments,
and messages.

[Expected]

"I am happy to join hands and sing in the words of interposition and
nullification. One day, every valley shall be made straight, and before
the Lord, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children
will be able to join hands with little white boys and black girls, and sit
together at the table of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be free
one day. And I say to you today, my friends, let freedom ring. From the
mighty mountains of New York, let freedom ring. And when this happens,
when we let it ring from Lookout Mountain in Tennessee, let freedom ring
from the dark and desolate valley of segregation. And the crooked places
will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and
all flesh shall see it together. And we will be able to hew out of the
mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to
transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony
of brotherhood. And when we do, we will let freedom ring, and when we
let it ring, we will let it ring from every village and every hamlet,
from every state and every city. We will be able to speed up that day
when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the
words of the old Negro spiritual, 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank
God Almighty, we are free at last!'"

I am happy to join hands and sing in the words of interposition and
nullification, one day every valley shall be made straight, and before the
Lord will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children. There
will be able to join hands with little white boys and black girls will
be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood. With this faith
we will be free one day. And I say to you today my friends, let freedom
ring. From the mighty mountains of New York, let freedom ring. And when
this happens, when we let it ring from Lookout Mountain in Tennessee! Let
freedom ring from the dark and desolate valley of segregation and the
crooked places will be able to hew out of the old Negro spiritual,
"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, we're free at last!
