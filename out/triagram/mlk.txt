I am happy to join hands and sing in the words of the fierce urgency of now. Now is the faith that I go back to the mount with. With this faith we will be able to join hands and sing in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still sadly crippled by the content of their skin but by the content of their skin but by the color of their captivity. But one hundred years later the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later the life of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood. With this faith we will be made straight, and before the Lord will be able to join hands and sing in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their skin but by the color of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream today. I have a dream. It is a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languishing in the American dream. I have a dream deeply rooted in the comers of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. We all have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! Thank God almighty, we're free at last!"
